**Forked from [Eugene Obrezkov](https://github.com/ghaiklor/generator-es6-npm-module).**

This generator creates empty npm module with es2017 support and integrated Travis and Coveralls services.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-es2017-npm-module
mkdir my-project && cd my-project
yo es2017-npm-module
```

Or you can create folder with your project and just copy\paste this code to terminal (you should be located under your project folder)

```bash
npm install -g yo generator-es2017-npm-module && yo es2017-npm-module
```

## Project structure

When project is generated you will get project with that structure:

```
|-- my-project
  |-- src
  |  |-- index.js
  |-- test
  |  |-- unit
  |  |  |-- index.test.js
  |  |-- mocha.opts
  |-- .babelrc
  |-- .editorconfig
  |-- .gitignore
  |-- .npmignore
  |-- .travis.yml
  |-- package.json
  |-- LICENSE
  |-- README.md
```

## Notes

### How to use coveralls service with travis ci?

Activate coveralls service for your repository on https://coveralls.io. Then add following code to `.travis.yml`.

```
script:
  - npm test
after_success:
  - npm run coveralls
```

I tried to run `npm run coveralls` locally, and got `422` error. It might be a bug of coveralls. So if you want light on coverage icon, use coveralls service with travis ci.

If you do not want to use coveralls service, just delete coveralls relevant script and devDependencies in `package.json`.
